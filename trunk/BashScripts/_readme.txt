This folder contains some Bash scripts for the preparation of images needed for the publication of the app (e.g. cropping screenshots).

They were developed for ChBoSync, i.e. they are not part of the PTBV SyncML client or Funambol's open source project.

These scripts are all distributed WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY!

Please read the comments at the top of the individual script files.

The scrips were tested using Cygwin32 on Windows 7 and OpenSuse 13.1;
the scripts working on images need ImageMagick to be installed.
