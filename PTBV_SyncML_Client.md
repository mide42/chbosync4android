_"PTBV SyncML Client"_ is a free Android app by Andreas Wolff, which is based on Funambol.


This app can be found in Google's App Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ptbv.android.syncmlclient



See the description in the App Store for details of what was changed in comparison to the _[Funambol](Funambol.md)_ client.



_ChBoSync_ is directly based on _"PTBV SyncML Client"_, and therefore indirectly based on the Funambol client.

The _"PTBV SyncML Client"_ cannot sync notes, but _ChBoSync_ can do this.
