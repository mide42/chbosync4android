=Changelog: Changes for version 1.1 of _ChBoSync_=

 * Self-signed certificates from the server are accepted (this feature from the _[PTBV_SyncML_Client]_ was not available in Version 1.1 of _ChBoSync_ due to a error during packaging of the external libs). Added warning on the login screen saying that such certificates are accepted by the app.

 * Improved translatable strings.

 * Added link to new sourcecode repository at _GitHub_ on about screen because of the _[http://google-opensource.blogspot.de/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html upcoming shutdown of "Google Code"]_.

Version 1.1 of _ChBoSync_ was released on 18 April 2015.
