#labels SyncML,Protocol,dataformat

_SyncML (Synchronization Markup Language)_ is an XML-based standard for synchronizing data like contacts, calendar entries, personal notes via networks between different personal devices of a user. For example, you add a new contact to your address book on your smartphone, and when you later work with your tablet computer this new contact is also available there (for this both devices have to be synced with the same account on a _SyncML_ server).

_ChBoSync_ is a client for _SyncML_. The groupware _[Horde]_ can act as _SyncML_ server (if the necessary modules are installed).
