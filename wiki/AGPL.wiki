This page is about the _"GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL)"_.

Funambol was released under the _AGPL version 3_, and therefore also _[PTBV_SyncML_Client]_ and _ChBoSync_ are released under this license.


For more information on the _AGPL_ (including the full text) see the following links:

*Disclaimer:* The following explanation of the _AGPL_ is for informal purposes only, i.e. it should be seen as a basic overview and is _NOT_ legally binding. For details please read the text of the original license.

The _AGPL_ can be considered as an extension of the _"GNU Public License (GPL)"_. The special feature of the _AGPL_ is that is also considers the case when the covered software is not directly distributed to the end users, but offered as a service over a network (e.g. as web-application over the internet). When the software is under the _GPL_, then the service provider (licensee) could alter the software without releasing the source code. In contrast to this, the _AGPL_ demands that the source code of the software has also to be released also in this case (section 13).


We assume that the _AGPL_ was chosen by Funambol because the source code released by them also contains server-side components. For the case of an Android app, which runs locally on the user's device, the conventional _GPL_ should be sufficient to ensure that the source code has to be published.

To comply with the _AGPL_ the source code of _ChBoSync_ is made available under the tab _"[https://code.google.com/p/ChBoSync4android/source/ Source]"_ of this project (Subversion repository containing an Eclipse project).
