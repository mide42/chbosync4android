=Using the Eclipse project=

The source code of _ChBoSync_ is provided as Eclipse project in the SVN repository of this project at _code.google.com_.

For the following description it is assumed that you have an installation of Eclipse with the _"Android Developer Tools (ADT)"_, which can be obtained at the following URL: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html


 * Check out the folder _"trunk/ChBoSync_EclipseProject"_ from the SVN repository of this project (see tab _"[https://code.google.com/p/chbosync4android/source/checkout Source]"_ of this GoogleCode project).

 * In Eclipse/ADT choose _"Import ..."_ in menu _"File"_.

 * Selection of import source: _"Existing Android Code Into Workspace"_ under node _"Android"_.

 * Folder to select as _"Root Directory"_: _"ChBoSync_EclipseProject"_

 * One project should appear in the table unter the _"Root Directory"_; ensure that in column _"Project to Import"_ this project is selected and click on button _"Finish"_.

 * The project contains all libraries needed for compiling in the folder _"external-libs"_ (several Funambol libraries and _"[joda_time_library Joda Time]"_).

 * Start the app in the emulator or a device connected via the _"Android Debug Bridge (ADB)"_ to your PC by opening the context menu (right button of mouse) of the node labled _"ChBoSync"_ in the _"Package Explorer"_ and choose _"Run As | Android Application"_. 


=Get along in the source code=

A good starting point for exploring the source code are the screen classes in package _de.chbosync.android.syncmlclient.activities_, e.g. _AndroidHomeScreen_ or _AndroidLoginScreen_. These classes are subclasses of class _android.app.Activity_.

The different types of data that can be synced (e.g., contacts, calendar or notes) are called _"Sync Sources"_. For the setup of each of these _Sync Sources_ there is a method in class _AndroidAppSyncSourceManager_, e.g. method _setupContactsSource()_. Each _Sync Source_ is an instance of class _AndroidAppSyncSource_, whereas this class inherits from class _AppSyncSource_. For some data types there are special sub classes of _AndroidAppSyncSource_, e.g. _CalendarAppSyncSource_ and _ContactAppSyncSource_.

The big buttons on the app's main screen used for triggering the syncing of a particular syncing action (e.g. syncing of contacts or notes) are instances of class _AndroidButtonUISyncSource_.
