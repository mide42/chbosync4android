==Syncing notes with a Horde server==

When used together with a [Horde] groupware server: There can be several notebooks. If there is more than just one notebook, then _ChBoSync_ seems to sync only the _first_ notebook, whereas _"first"_ means the first notebook according to the alphabetical order (i.e. the notebook that is the upper-most one in the list of notebooks on the left side of the WebUI).
